  "brief": "I am a dedicated web developer eager to craft products of varied scope which push me to expand my current skill set. My university experience taught me to regard web development as a never-ending learning experience. This fixation with the learning journey and this computing discipline has allowed me to acquire considerable experience as a leader of web development teams. Currently, I aim to more clearly define the role I would like to occupy in the web development space.",
